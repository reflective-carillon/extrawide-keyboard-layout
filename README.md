# "Extra wide" ergonomic layout for non-split keyboards

Standard keyboards are common and uncomfortable. Pondering this, I remembered how Colemak users
have developed a "wide" layout, where the right hand is shifted one key to the right,
to reduce strain on the wrists. (http://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/wide.html)
So, I had the idea to go even further, and shift the left hand one key to the left as well. 
Since this means there is no left pinky shift, caps lock, or tab, I had to put them somewhere. 
The newly-freed middle columns are one natural place, so I decided to mimic the default layout of 
the Model01 (https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-01-keyboard), since my partner has one 
and it looks cool. With that decided, I went ahead and made this layout resemble the Model01 
layout to a large degree. The exceptions are that there is a row of (home, page down, page up, end) 
right below the arrow keys, the hyphen, backslash, and backtick are in different places since 
that's where they fit, I added a super key, caps lock, and compose keys, and of course the thumb 
keys are different and there's no palm key. One final feature, again borrowed from the Colemak 
community: the "angle mod", where the lowest row of keys for the left hand are shifted to 
the left so that keys pressed with a single finger are lined up with the finger's motion 
(http://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html).

### Details

The "m01fn" key is like the "fn" key on the Model01. Holding it down changes the keys on 
the right hand. In combination with the original escape key, it switches between Colemak-DH and QWERTY.

The "multi" key is what xkb calls a "compose" key, which provides shortcuts for special characters. 
For example, the sequence of compose, apostrophe, and "e" makes "Ã©".

"sup" is the "super" key, which I only ever use by tapping it to reveal all open windows. 
"ret" is return/enter. I have two of them because the one on the home row matches 
the positioning on the default layout of the Model01, but I find the other one much easier to reach.

Since both thumbs can reach the space bar, and I don't like holding with a thumb while 
reaching for keys with the same hand, it made sense to use it for something that requires 
frequent holding in combination with all other keys, so either shift or control.

I don't need an AltGr key, since the multi key is enough for my occasional use of non-English 
characters, but I'm aware that this is a significant flaw in making this layout useful for other 
people. I'm not sure where would be a good place to add one. Ideally, I would like holding the 
backspace key to be m01fn, but I couldn't figure out how to make this work in xkb without also 
sending a backspace. If that were possible, then holding the space key for AltGr seems nice.
